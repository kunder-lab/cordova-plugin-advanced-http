# SSL Pinning

## Implementation

1. Add SSL Certificates (*.cer) to www/certificates folder
2. Use "[setSSLCertMode](https://github.com/kunder-lab/cordova-plugin-advanced-http#setsslcertmode)" to enable SSL Pinning (mode "pinned")
3. Use "[sendRequest](https://github.com/kunder-lab/cordova-plugin-advanced-http#sendrequest)" to make a request to server and wait for callback
4. If error callback was trigger, check if the response.error equals -2, because that would mean that the network is not secure

## sendRequest Callback Error Examples

| -1 | Could not decode response data due to invalid or unknown charset encoding | CharacterCodingException |
| -1 | Could not decode response data due to malformed data | MalformedInputException |
| -1 | There was an error generating the response | JSONException |
| -1 | There was an error with the request: + ex.getMessage() | HttpRequestException (Generic) |
| **-2** | **SSL handshake failed** | **SSLHandshakeException** |

## Testing & Simulating MITM

### You will need
- Desktop/Notebook
- Mobile device (Android/iOS)

Note: Both must be connected to the same network

###  Setup

1. Download & install [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/)
2. In terminal run `mitmproxy`
3. On device:
- Go to "Edit network" (on Android, long press current conneted network at Wi-Fi's menu)
- Set proxy to "manual"
- Set proxy hostname to PC's local ip address
- Set proxy port to 8080
- Save changes
- Open web browser, load any website and you should see mitproxy intercepting the traffic:

4. Now check your app and you should see how when you make a request through sendRequest, it will fail with code -2, indicating an insecure network:
